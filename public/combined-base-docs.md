**Unneeded contract addresses**

Certain contracts are mandatory according to the [OP Stack SDK](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/build/sdk/#unneeded-contract-addresses), despite not being utilized. For such contracts, you can simply assign the zero address:

- `StateCommitmentChain`
- `CanonicalTransactionChain`
- `BondManager`

# Quick Start: Deploy on Base

Welcome to the Base deployment quickstart guide! This comprehensive walkthrough will help you set up your environment and deploy smart contracts on Base. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this guide has got you covered.

## What You'll Achieve

By the end of this quickstart, you'll be able to:

- Set up your development environment to deploy on Base
- Deploy your smart contracts to Base
- Connect your frontend to your smart contracts

:::tip Why Base?

Base is a fast, low-cost, builder-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users onchain. By following this guide, you'll join a vibrant ecosystem of developers, creators, and innovators who are building a global onchain economy.

:::

## Set Up Your Development Environment

1. Create a new project directory

```bash
mkdir my-base-project && cd my-base-project
```

2. Install Foundry, a powerful framework for smart contract development

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

This installs Foundry and updates it to the latest version.

3. Initialize a new Solidity project

```bash
forge init
```

Your Foundry project is now ready. You'll find an example contract in the `src` directory, which you can replace with your own contracts. For the purposes of this guide, we'll use the Counter contract provided in `/src/Counter.sol`

:::tip
Foundry provides a suite of tools for Ethereum application development, including Forge (for testing), Cast (for interacting with the chain), and Anvil (for setting up a local node). You can learn more about Foundry [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).
:::

## Configure Foundry with Base

To deploy your smart contracts to Base, you need two key components:

1. A node connection to interact with the Base network
2. A funded private key to deploy the contract

Let's set up both of these:

### 1. Set up your node connection

1. Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory
2. Add the Base network RPC URL to your `.env` file

```bash
BASE_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.base.org"
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://sepolia.base.org"
```

3. Load your environment variables

```bash
source .env
```

:::tip
Base Sepolia is the test network for Base, which we will use for the rest of this guide. You can obtain free Base Sepolia ETH from one of the [faucets listed here](/docs/tools/network-faucets).
:::

### 2. Secure your private key

1. Store your private key in Foundry's secure keystore

```bash
cast wallet import deployer --interactive
```

2. When prompted enter your private key and a password.

Your private key is stored in `~/.foundry/keystores` which is not tracked by git.

:::warning
Never share or commit your private key. Always keep it secure and handle with care.
:::

## Deploy Your Contracts

Now that your environment is set up, let's deploy your contracts to Base Sepolia.

1. Use the following command to compile and deploy your contract

```bash
forge create ./src/Counter.sol:Counter --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --account deployer
```

Note the format of the contract being deployed is `<contract-path>:<contract-name>`.

2. After successful deployment, the transaction hash will be printed to the console output

3. Copy the deployed contract address and add it to your `.env` file

```bash
COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0x..."
```

4. Load the new environment variable

```bash
source .env
```

### Verify Your Deployment

To ensure your contract was deployed successfully:

1. Check the transaction on [Sepolia Basescan](https://sepolia.basescan.org/).
2. Use the `cast` command to interact with your deployed contract from the command line

```bash
cast call $COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "number()(uint256)" --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

This will return the initial value of the Counter contract's `number` storage variable, which will be `0`.

**Congratulations! You've deployed your smart contracts to Base Sepolia!**

## Next Steps

- Use [Onchainkit](https://onchainkit.com) to connect your frontend to your contracts! Onchainkit is a library of ready-to-use React components and Typescript utilities.
- Learn more about interacting with your contracts in the command line using Foundry from our [Foundry tutorial](/tutorials/deploy-with-foundry).

# Fees

## How do network fees on Base work?

Every Base transaction consists of two costs: an L2 (execution) fee and an L1
(security) fee. The L2 fee is the cost to execute your transaction on the L2,
and the L1 fee is the estimated cost to publish the transaction on the L1.
Typically the L1 security fee is higher than the L2 execution fee.

The L1 fee will vary depending on the amount of transactions on the L1. If the
timing of your transaction is flexible, you can save costs by submitting
transactions during periods of lower gas on the L1 (for example, over the
weekend)

Similarly, the L2 fee can increase and decrease depending on how many
transactions are being submitted to the L2. This adjustment mechanism has the
same implementation as the L1; you can read more about it
[here](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/eip-1559).

For additional details about fee calculation on Base, please refer to the
[op-stack developer
documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/transactions/fees).

# Differences between Ethereum and Base

Base is built on the [Bedrock](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/explainer/) release of the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), which is designed from the ground up to be as close to Ethereum as possible. Because of this, there are very few differences when it comes to building on Base and Ethereum.

However, there are still some minor discrepancies between the behavior of Base and Ethereum that you should be aware of when building apps on top of Base.

These minor differences include:

- [Opcodes](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#opcode-differences)
- [Blocks](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#blocks)
- [Network specifications](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#network-specifications)
- [Transaction costs](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#transaction-costs)

# Add Basenames to your onchain app

[Basenames] is now live! But what exactly is it? Basenames allows users to register human-readable names for their addresses and serves as a foundational building block for onchain identity. Think of it as your favorite social media handle, but even bigger. Your Basename is multichain by default and yours forever—no platform can take it away from you (just make sure to pay your fee).

Integrating Basenames into your onchain app enhances the user experience by masking complex wallet addresses. Just as domains simplify IP addresses, Basenames do the same for wallet addresses.

This tutorial shows you how to display Basenames on behalf of your users. We'll walk through setting up the necessary files and configurations to interact with the Basenames ENS resolver directly. Let's begin!

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

- Understand how onchain identity works on the Base network
- Enable users to use their onchain identity in your app
- Pull metadata from your users' Basename profile

## Steps

First, create a directory to store the ABI (Application Binary Interface) for the Basenames ENS resolver. The ABI will allow your project to interact with the smart contract that handles Basenames.

In your project folder, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir abis
cd abis
touch L2ResolverAbi.ts
```

This will create a new directory named `abis` and a file named L2ResolverAbi.ts within it.

Next, add the following placeholder code to the `L2ResolverAbi.ts` file:

```typescript title="src/abis/L2ResolverAbi.ts"
export default [
  // ABI information goes here
] as const;
```

:::tip

You will need to replace the placeholder comment with the actual ABI. Here is the link to the full [L2ResolverAbi].

:::

To interact with the Base blockchain, you will need to update the wagmi configuration. This will allow your project to connect to the Base network and use its features.

Update your wagmi.ts file as follows:

```typescript tile="wagmi.ts"
'use client';

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { ReactNode } from 'react';
import { http, createConfig, WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi';
import { base } from 'wagmi/chains';

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [base],
  transports: {
    [base.id]: http(),
  },
  ssr: true,
});

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export default function EthereumProviders({
  children,
}: {
  children: ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
}
```

This code sets up your application to use the Base network, enabling the project to interact with the blockchain.

Next, we'll create a new directory to house the functions that will resolve and interact with Basenames. These functions will be responsible for fetching Basename information from the blockchain.

In your project folder, create the apis directory and add a basenames.tsx file:

:::note What's happening in the code? 

`convertReverseNodeToBytes()`: This function is creating the reverse node so we can look up a name given an address. Each address gets its own reverse record in our registry that's created in a deterministic way.

You can see the implementation of `convertReverseNodeToBytes()` in the [OnchainKit repo]

`BasenameTextRecordKeys`: Metadata (e.g., github, twitter, etc.) are stored as text records so we can look them up based on the enum key.

:::

```typescript title="src/apis/basenames.tsx"
import {
  Address,
  ContractFunctionParameters,
  createPublicClient,
  encodePacked,
  http,
  keccak256,
  namehash,
} from 'viem';
import { base, mainnet } from 'viem/chains';
import L2ResolverAbi from '@/abis/L2ResolverAbi';

// Function to resolve a Basename
export async function getBasename(address: Address) {
  try {
    const addressReverseNode = convertReverseNodeToBytes(address, base.id);
    const basename = await baseClient.readContract({
      abi: L2ResolverAbi,
      address: BASENAME_L2_RESOLVER_ADDRESS,
      functionName: 'name',
      args: [addressReverseNode],
    });
    if (basename) {
      return basename as BaseName;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle the error accordingly
    console.error('Error resolving Basename:', error);
  }
}
```

This code provides the foundation for resolving Basenames using the Base network.

:::tip

You can find the complete implementation in the full [basenames.tsx] file.

:::

Now that the necessary functions are in place, you can implement the Basenames functionality in your app. For this example, we'll modify the `page.tsx` file to display Basename information on the server and client side.

Here's how to set it up:

```typescript title="src/app/page.tsx"
import {
  BasenameTextRecordKeys,
  getBasename,
  getBasenameAvatar,
  getBasenameTextRecord,
} from '@/apis/basenames';
import BasenameDetails from '@/components/BasenameDetails';
import EthereumProviders from '@/contexts/EthereumProviders';
import { useAccount } from 'wagmi';

// shrek.base.eth

const address = '0x8c8F1a1e1bFdb15E7ed562efc84e5A588E68aD73'; // const account = useAccount(); \n address = account?.address;

async function fetchData() {
  const basename = await getBasename(address);

  if (basename === undefined) throw Error('failed to resolve address to name');

  const avatar = await getBasenameAvatar(basename);

  const description = await getBasenameTextRecord(
    basename,
    BasenameTextRecordKeys.Description
  );

  const twitter = await getBasenameTextRecord(
    basename,
    BasenameTextRecordKeys.Twitter
  );

  return {
    basename,
    avatar,
    description,
    twitter,
  };
}

export default async function Home() {
  const data = await fetchData();

  return (
    <EthereumProviders>
      <main className='flex min-h-screen flex-col gap-12 p-24'>
        <div className='mb-12'>
          <h1 className='text-xl mb-4'>Server-side rendered:</h1>
          <ul className='flex flex-col gap-4'>
            <li className='flex flex-col gap-2'>
              <span>Address</span>
              <strong>{address}</strong>
            </li>
            <li className='flex flex-col gap-2'>
              <span>Basename</span>
              <strong>{data.basename}</strong>
            </li>
            <li className='flex flex-col gap-2'>
              <span>Avatar</span>
              <strong>
                <img
                  src={data.avatar}
                  alt={data.basename}
                  width={100}
                  height={100}
                />
              </strong>
            </li>
            <li className='flex flex-col gap-2'>
              <span>Description</span>
              <strong>{data.description}</strong>
            </li>
            <li className='flex flex-col gap-2'>
              <span>Twitter</span>
              <strong>{data.twitter}</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1 className='text-xl mb-4'>Client-side rendered:</h1>
          <BasenameDetails address={address} />
        </div>
      </main>
    </EthereumProviders>
  );
}
```

In this example, the Home component fetches Basename data and displays it in both server-side and client-side rendered sections. This allows your app to provide a seamless user experience, showing Basename details like the avatar, description, and associated Twitter handle.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully integrated Basenames into your project. By setting up the necessary ABI, configuring your wagmi project, and implementing custom functions to resolve and display Basenames, you've enhanced your app's user experience by making wallet addresses more user-friendly. Your users can now enjoy a personalized, recognizable onchain identity across the Base network. Keep exploring and building to unlock even more possibilities with Basenames!

To get started using the SDK, you must first initialize an instance of `ThirdWebSDK`, and connect to the Base network by passing in the `Base` chain.

To initialize the SDK with the Base network and get a contract:

```javascript
import { Base } from '@thirdweb-dev/chains';
import { ThirdwebSDK } from '@thirdweb-dev/sdk/evm';

const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(Base);
const contract = await sdk.getContract('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000');
```

:::info

The code snippet above uses the [React SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react). The thirdweb SDKs are also available in [React Native](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react-native), [TypeScript](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript), [Python](https://portal.thirdweb.com/python), [Go](https://portal.thirdweb.com/go), and [Unity](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity).

If alternatively you'd like to initialize the SDK with Base Sepolia (testnet), use the following code instead:

```javascript
import { BaseSepoliaTestnet } from '@thirdweb-dev/chains';
import { ThirdwebSDK } from '@thirdweb-dev/sdk/evm';

const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(BaseSepoliaTestnet);
const contract = await sdk.getContract('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000');
```

## Interacting with smart contracts

Once you initialize the SDK and connect to a smart contract deployed to Base, you can start calling functions on it using the SDK.

:::info

Any interaction you make with a smart contract will be made from the connected wallet automatically.

:::

### Using contract extension functions

The thirdweb SDK provides convenience functions when your smart contract uses [extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit/extensions). This is the easiest way to read data and write transactions with your smart contracts.

For example, if your contract implements the [ERC721](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit/erc721) extension, you can utilize all of the functions of the [corresponding erc721 standard](https://portal.thirdweb.com/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc721) in the SDK.

As an example, below is a code snippet that uses [`useOwnedNFTs`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.useownednfts) hook to get a list of NFTs owned by a single wallet address:

```javascript
import { useOwnedNFTs } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

const { data, isLoading, error } = useOwnedNFTs(contract, '{{wallet_address}}');
```

#### Usage

```javascript
import { useOwnedNFTs, useContract, useAddress } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = '{{contract_address}}';

function App() {
  const address = useAddress();
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useOwnedNFTs(contract, address);
}
```

For more examples on using contract extension functions, visit the [thirdweb developer documentation](https://portal.thirdweb.com/sdk/interacting-with-contracts#using-contract-extensions).

### Reading contract data

If your contract doesn’t use any [extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit/extensions), or you want to directly call functions on your smart contract to read data, you can use the [`useContractRead`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usecontractread) hook.

Read data on your contract from a connected wallet:

```javascript
const { contract } = useContract('{{contract_address}}');
const { data: myData, isLoading } = useContractRead(contract, 'myFunction');
```

### Writing transactions

If your contract doesn’t use any [extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit/extensions), or you want to directly call functions on your smart contract to write data, you can use the [`useContractWrite`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usecontractwrite) hook.

Make transactions on your contract from a connected wallet:

```javascript
const { contract } = useContract('{{contract_address}}');
const { mutateAsync: myFunctionAsync } = useContractWrite(contract, 'myFunction');
const tx = await myFunctionAsync(['argument1', 'argument2']); // Call the function
```

# web3.js

[web3.js](https://web3js.org/) is a JavaScript library that allows developers to interact with EVM-compatible blockchain networks.

You can use web3.js to interact with smart contracts deployed on the Base network.

---

## Install

To install web3.js run the following command:

```bash
npm install web3
```

## Setup

Before you can start using web3.js, you need to import it into your project.

Add the following line of code to the top of your file to import web3.js:

```javascript
//web3.js v1
const Web3 = require('web3');

//web3.js v4
const { Web3 } = require('web3');
```

## Connecting to Base

You can connect to Base by instantiating a new web3.js `Web3` object with a RPC URL of the Base network:

```javascript
const { Web3 } = require('web3');

const web3 = new Web3('https://mainnet.base.org');
```

:::info

To alternatively connect to Base Sepolia (testnet), change the above URL from `https://mainnet.base.org` to `https://sepolia.base.org`.

:::

## Accessing data

Once you have created a provider, you can use it to read data from the Base network.

For example, you can use the `getBlockNumber` method to get the latest block:

```javascript
async function getLatestBlock(address) {
  const latestBlock = await web3.eth.getBlockNumber();
  console.log(latestBlock.toString());
}
```

## Deploying contracts

Before you can deploy a contract to the Base network using web3.js, you must first create an account.

You can create an account by using `web3.eth.accounts`:

```javascript
const privateKey = “PRIVATE_KEY”;
const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);
```

:::info

`PRIVATE_KEY` is the private key of the wallet to use when creating the account.

:::

## Interacting with smart contracts

You can use web3.js to interact with a smart contract on Base by instantiating a `Contract` object using the ABI and address of a deployed contract:

```javascript
const abi = [
… // ABI of deployed contract
];

const contractAddress = "CONTRACT_ADDRESS"

const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);
```

Once you have created a `Contract` object, you can use it to call desired methods on the smart contract:

```javascript
async function setValue(value) {
  // write query
  const tx = await contract.methods.set(value).send();
  console.log(tx.transactionHash);
}

async function getValue() {
  // read query
  const value = await contract.methods.get().call();
  console.log(value.toString());
}
```

# ethers.js

[ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) is a JavaScript library that allows developers to interact with EVM-compatible blockchain networks.

You can use ethers.js to interact with smart contracts deployed on the Base network.

---

## Install

To install ethers.js run the following command:

```bash
npm install --save ethers
```

## Setup

Before you can start using ethers.js, you need to import it into your project.

Add the following line of code to the top of your file to import ethers.js:

```javascript
const ethers = require('ethers');
```

## Connecting to Base

You can connect to Base by instantiating a new ethers.js `JsonRpcProvider` object with a RPC URL of the Base network:

```javascript
const ethers = require('ethers');

const url = 'https://mainnet.base.org';
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(url);
```

:::info

To alternatively connect to Base Sepolia (testnet), change the above URL from `https://mainnet.base.org` to `https://sepolia.base.org`.

:::

## Reading data from the blockchain

Once you have created a provider, you can use it to read data from the Base network.

For example, you can use the `getBlockNumber` method to get the latest block:

```javascript
async function getLatestBlock() {
  const latestBlock = await provider.getBlockNumber();
  console.log(latestBlock);
}
```

## Writing data to the blockchain

In order to write data to the Base network, you need to create a `Signer`.

You can create a `Signer` by instantiating a new ethers.js `Wallet` object, providing it with a private key and `Provider`.

```javascript
const privateKey = 'PRIVATE_KEY';
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);
```

:::info

`PRIVATE_KEY` is the private key of the wallet to use when creating the signer.

:::

## Interacting with smart contracts

You can use ethers.js to interact with a smart contract on Base by instantiating a `Contract` object using the ABI and address of a deployed contract:

```javascript
const abi = [
… // ABI of deployed contract
];

const contractAddress = "CONTRACT_ADDRESS"

// read only
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, provider);
```

For write-only contracts, provide a `Signer` object instead of a `Provider` object:

```javascript
// write only
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, signer);
```

:::info

`CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is the address of the deployed contract.

:::

Once you have created a `Contract` object, you can use it to call desired methods on the smart contract:

```javascript
async function setValue(value) {
  const tx = await contract.set(value);
  console.log(tx.hash);
}

async function getValue() {
  const value = await contract.get();
  console.log(value.toString());
}
```

## Programmatic Bridging

See the [sample code repository](https://github.com/base-org/guides/tree/main/bridge/native) to see how to bridge ETH and ERC-20s from Ethereum to Base.

:::caution

**Double check the token address for ERC-20s** You can use any ERC-20 that is
supported on the network. You can check what assets are on Base and the
corresponding contract address via [this hub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/tree/master/data).
Ensure there is an address for `base`, [example](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/blob/master/data/WETH/data.json#L16-L18).
Always test with small amounts to ensure the system is working as expected.

:::

:::caution
This implementation only can bridge assets to Base. Do not attempt to alter the
code to withdraw the assets.

# Onchain Registry FAQ

---

### What happens after I submit my project?

We want to keep the Registry as open and permissionless as we can, but we also need to run entries through a lightweight review process to make sure we are protecting our end users as much as reasonably possible. All reviews are queued based on order of submission. Review times will vary based on the complexity of the entry.

---

### How do I edit my entry if I made a mistake?

To edit your original entry, use our [Registry edit form](https://base.org/registry-edit). This form will ask you for your original entry ID, which you can find at the bottom of your original entry's confirmation email. On the edit form, you only need to fill in the fields that you would like to change.

---

### Why was my entry rejected?

Some common examples of projects we cannot feature at this time include:

- Expired NFT mints
- ERC-404 collections (e.g. tokens that can be used as fractionalized NFT assets)
- Platforms that offer investment strategies/financial advice or involve the offer, sale or distribution of unregistered securities in violation of applicable securities laws
- Services, products or platforms that do not comply with the Coinbase [Prohibited Use Policy](https://www.coinbase.com/legal/prohibited_use)

---

### How can I pull entries from the Registry?

We offer an Onchain Registry API that gives users the ability to display Onchain Registry entries on their own surfaces. Our Onchain Registry API docs can be found [here](/docs/tools/registry-api/).

<!-- File: ../web/apps/base-docs/docs/tools/basenames-faq.md -->

title: Basenames FAQ
slug: /tools/basenames-faq
description: 'Frequently asked questions on basenames.'
keywords: ['basenames', 'faq']
tags: ['basenames']
displayed_sidebar: null
---

## FAQ

### 1. What are Basenames?

[Basenames](https://base.org/names) are a core onchain building block that enable builders to establish their identity on Base by registering human-readable names for their wallet address(es). They are fully onchain, built on the same technology powering ENS names and deployed on Base. These human-readable names can be used when connecting to onchain apps, and sending and receiving on Base and any other EVM chain. Get your Basename at [base.org/names](https://base.org/names).

### 2. What are the Basename registration fees?

Basenames are priced based on name length, and are designed to be globally accessible. Annual registration fees are as follows:

| Letters | Annual fee |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 3       | 0.1 ETH    |
| 4       | 0.01 ETH   |
| 5-9     | 0.001 ETH  |
| 10+     | 0.0001 ETH |

### 3. How do I get a free or discounted Basename?

You can get one free Basename (5+ letters) for one year if you meet any of the below criteria:

- [Coinbase Verification](http://coinbase.com/onchain-verify)
- [Coinbase One Verification](http://coinbase.com/onchain-verify) (free renewals with active subscription)
- [Summer Pass Level 3 NFT](https://wallet.coinbase.com/ocs)
- [Buildathon participant NFT](https://onchain-summer.devfolio.co/)
- [base.eth NFT holder](https://opensea.io/collection/base-org-base-eth)
- cb.id username (acquired prior to Fri Aug 9, 2024)
- [BNS name owner](http://basename.app) - free 4+ letter name (basename.app)

An equivalent-value discount of 0.001 ETH will be applied if registering a shorter name, or registering for more than 1 year, with the exception of the BNS name owner discount (valued at 0.01 ETH per unique address). You will need to pay the standard registration fees if you wish to keep your Basename after your initial discount has been fully applied. Discounts are only applied once, and are limited to one per address. Even if you meet multiple criteria, you will only be eligible for a single discount on one Basename. If you satisfy multiple criteria, we will automatically apply the highest-value discount to your registration.

We are always looking to add more discounts. If you or your project have ideas for more discounts, please reach out.

### 4. Why is there an auction at launch, and how does it work?

Upon initial launch, there will be a temporary premium placed on all Basenames in the form of a Dutch auction, to ensure a fair and quality distribution of names, and to maximize everyone's chance of getting a name they like without being outcompeted by bots. The premium will start at 100 ETH and decay exponentially over the course of 36 hours. Premiums will be added on to the total registration cost of a Basename. Please note: the premium is intentionally designed to be high so that names can't be instantly bought by bots or traders, and can instead enable fairer access and price discovery for the general public.

### 5. Do I have to pay gas to register a Basename?

If registering with a Smart Wallet, registrations will be gasless, sponsored by Base.

### 6. How long can I register a Basename for?

There is no limit to registration length, but there is a minimum of 1 year.

### 7. How can I use my Basename?

You can use your Basename across apps in the Base ecosystem, starting with base.org, Onchain Registry, and Onchain Summer Pass. You can also use it for sending and receiving on Base and other EVM chains.

### 8. Is my profile information published onchain?

Basenames are fully onchain, and therefore any information you publish is recorded onchain, requires a transaction, and will be broadly composable with the rest of the ecosystem. Please do not publish any information you do not wish to be onchain.

### 9. How do I set my Basename as my primary name for my address?

You can set your Name as your primary name by updating this in Profile Management. If you set your Basename as your primary name, it will be displayed on any wallet or app that has added support for Basenames.

### 10. How do I transfer my Basename to another address?

You can transfer your Basename to another address through Profile Management:

1. Transfer token ownership - transfers ownership of the Basename token and associated permissions.
2. Transfer management - transfers ability to manage and update profile records.
3. Change address resolution - Basename will resolve to a new address.

Transferring all 3 to the same address will fully transfer ownership of the Basename to that address.

### 11. What happens if I forget to renew my Basename?

If you forget to renew your Name, it will enter a grace period of 90-days, during which you can still renew it. If not renewed during this period, the Basename will become available for others to register.

### 12. What happens if a Basename is not renewed during the grace period?

If a Basename is not renewed after the 90 day grace period, it will be subject to a [temporary premium](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7900612-temporary-premium) in the form of a Dutch auction. This premium starts at 100ETH and will decay exponentially over the course of 21 days.

### 13. Can I link multiple addresses to my Basename?

Currently, only one address at a time can be linked to a Basename. However, we plan to support multi-address linking in the future.

### 14. I am a builder. How do I integrate Basenames to my app?

If you're a builder looking to integrate Basenames into your app, [OnchainKit](https://onchainkit.xyz/wallet/wallet-dropdown-basename) is the easiest way to get started (tutorial [here](https://docs.base.org/docs/basenames-tutorial-with-onchainkit)). If you have ideas for new features or badges that you'd like to integrate with Basenames, we'd love to [hear from you](https://app.deform.cc/form/b9c1c39f-f238-459e-a765-5093ca638075/?page_number=0).

### 15. How do I get a Basename for my app or project?

You can register a Basename for your app just like any other Basename. If a Basename for your app or project is not available, there is a good chance it was reserved. Please reach out to our team or fill out this [form](https://app.deform.cc/form/20372eb6-ec97-4d37-967f-d36f4b7f4eb2) and we will reach out with instructions.

### 16. How are Basenames built?

Basenames are built using the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) protocol, leveraging its decentralized architecture to ensure secure and efficient name resolution.

### 17. Do Basenames work on different chains?

Yes, your Name will work on any chain as long as the app is ENSIP-10 compliant. Note that when sending money or interacting across different chains, you should ensure the receiving platform supports ENS.

### 18. How do I use frames with my basename?

You can pin frames as the ultimate way to make a profile yours. Want someone to mint? Frame it. Want someone to pay you? Frame it. Want to display your onchain identity your own way? Frame it.

Follow our step-by-step [guide] to get started. While Basenames supports all frames, we recommend using the Open Frames standard for the best experience.

## API3

The API3 Market provides access to 200+ price feeds on [Base Mainnet](https://market.api3.org/base) and [Base Testnet](https://market.api3.org/base-sepolia-testnet). The price feeds operate as a native push oracle and can be activated instantly via the Market UI.

The price feeds are delivered by an aggregate of first-party oracles using signed data and support OEV recapture.

Unlike traditional data feeds, reading API3 price feeds enables dApps to auction off the right to update the price feeds to searcher bots which facilitates more efficient liquidation processes for users and LPs of DeFi money markets. The OEV recaptured is returned to the dApp.

Apart from data feeds, API3 also provides Quantum Random Number Generation on Base Mainnet and Testnet. QRNG is a free-to-use service that provides quantum randomness onchain. It is powered by Airnode, the first-party oracle that is directly operated by the QRNG API providers.

# viem

:::info

Viem is currently only available on Base Sepolia testnet.

:::

[viem](https://viem.sh/) a TypeScript interface for Ethereum that provides low-level stateless primitives for interacting with Ethereum.

You can use viem to interact with smart contracts deployed on Base.

---

## Install

To install viem run the following command:

```bash
npm install --save viem
```

## Setup

Before you can start using viem, you need to setup a [Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/intro.html) with a desired [Transport](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/intro.html) and [Chain](https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction).

```javascript
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem';
import { base } from 'viem/chains';

const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: http(),
});
```

:::info

To use Base, you must specify `base` as the chain when creating a Client.

To use Base Sepolia (testnet), replace `base` with `baseSepolia`.

:::

## Reading data from the blockchain

Once you have created a client, you can use it to read and access data from Base using [Public Actions](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/introduction.html)

Public Actions are client methods that map one-to-one with a "public" Ethereum RPC method (`eth_blockNumber`, `eth_getBalance`, etc.)

For example, you can use the `getBlockNumber` client method to get the latest block:

```javascript
const blockNumber = await client.getBlockNumber();
```

## Writing data to the blockchain

In order to write data to Base, you need to create a Wallet client (`createWalletClient`) and specify an [`Account`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/) to use.

```javascript
import { createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem'
import { base } from 'viem/chains'

//highlight-start
const [account] = await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })
//highlight-end

const client = createWalletClient({
  //highlight-next-line
  account,
  chain: base,
  transport: custom(window.ethereum)
})

client.sendTransaction({ ... })
```

:::info

In addition to making a JSON-RPC request (`eth_requestAccounts`) to get an Account, viem provides various helper methods for creating an `Account`, including: [`privateKeyToAccount`](https://viem.sh/docs/accounts/privateKey.html), [`mnemonicToAccount`](https://viem.sh/docs/accounts/mnemonic.html), and [`hdKeyToAccount`](https://viem.sh/docs/accounts/hd.html).

To use Base Sepolia (testnet), replace `base` with `baseSepolia`.

:::

## Interacting with smart contracts

You can use viem to interact with a smart contract on Base by creating a `Contract` instance using [`getContract`](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/getContract.html) and passing it the contract ABI, contract address, and [Public](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public.html) and/or [Wallet](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html) Client:

```javascript
import { getContract } from 'viem';
import { wagmiAbi } from './abi';
import { publicClient } from './client';

// 1. Create contract instance
const contract = getContract({
  address: 'CONTRACT_ADDRESS',
  abi: wagmiAbi,
  publicClient,
});

// 2. Call contract methods, listen to events, etc.
const result = await contract.read.totalSupply();
```

:::info

`CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is the address of the deployed contract.

description: 'A tutorial that teaches how to integrate Basenames to your wagmi/viem App using OnchainKit'

tags: ['account abstraction']

# Add Basenames to your wagmi/viem App using OnchainKit

[Basenames] is now live! But what exactly is it? Basenames allows users to register human-readable names for their addresses and serves as a foundational building block for onchain identity. Think of it as your favorite social media handle, but even bigger. Your Basename is multichain by default and yours forever—no platform can take it away from you (just make sure to pay your fee).

Integrating Basenames into your onchain app enhances the user experience by masking complex wallet addresses. Just as domains simplify IP addresses, Basenames do the same for wallet addresses.

[OnchainKit] is a React component library designed to make building Onchain applications easier. In this tutorial, we'll use the `<Identity/>` component to resolve Basenames.

This demo uses Coinbase Smart Wallet and Coinbase Wallet, but Basenames is supported across many [other wallets].

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

- Understand how onchain identity works on the Base network
- Enable users to use their onchain identity in your app using [OnchainKit]

---

If you're starting from scratch, you'll need to create a new wagmi project. If you already have an existing wagmi project, you can skip ahead to the section on installing OnchainKit.

To create a new wagmi project using TypeScript and install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
bun create wagmi
```

Next, you'll need to install OnchainKit. Run the following command:

```bash
bun add @coinbase/onchainkit
```

After adding OnchainKit, install all dependencies and start your development server with:

```
bun install && bun run dev
```

This command will install the necessary dependencies and start a development server.

To follow along with the tutorial effectively, open your web browser and your IDE side by side. This setup will allow you to code and see the changes in real time.

### Update Wagmi config

In this section, we will configure your wagmi project to support the Base blockchain by importing the necessary modules.

Start by importing the `base` and `baseSepolia` chains into your wagmi config. Navigate to `src/wagmi.ts` and update the file as follows:

```typescript title="wagmi.ts"
import { http, cookieStorage, createConfig, createStorage } from 'wagmi';
import { base, baseSepolia } from 'wagmi/chains';
import { coinbaseWallet, injected } from 'wagmi/connectors';

export function getConfig() {
  return createConfig({
    chains: [base, baseSepolia],
    connectors: [
      injected(),
      coinbaseWallet({
        appName: 'Create Wagmi',
        preference: 'smartWalletOnly',
      }),
    ],
    storage: createStorage({
      storage: cookieStorage,
    }),
    ssr: true,
    transports: {
      [base.id]: http(),
      [baseSepolia.id]: http(),
    },
  });
}

declare module 'wagmi' {
  interface Register {
    config: ReturnType<typeof getConfig>;
  }
}
```

This configuration sets up the wagmi project to connect to the Base and BaseSepolia networks, utilizing Coinbase Wallet and other connectors.

Now we’ll create a component to display the Basenames associated with an address.

:::tip Use Base as your chain
Ensure Chain is Set to Base Be sure to set the `chain={base}` parameter; otherwise, it will default to ENS (Ethereum Name Service).
:::

```typescript title="src/components/basename.tsx"
'use client';
import React from 'react';
'use client';
import React from 'react';
import { Avatar, Identity, Name, Address } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/identity';
import { base } from 'viem/chains';

interface DisplayBasenameProps {
  address: `0x${string}` | undefined;
}

export function Basenames({ address }: DisplayBasenameProps) {
  return (
    <Identity
      address={address}
      chain={base}
      schemaId="0xf8b05c79f090979bf4a80270aba232dff11a10d9ca55c4f88de95317970f0de9"
    >
      <Avatar address={address} chain={base} />
      <Name address={address} chain={base} />
      <Address />
    </Identity>
  );
}
```

This component uses OnchainKit to fetch and display the Basename, Avatar, and Address associated with the provided address.

:::note Style the Avatar
Remember to style the Avatar component to fit your application's design.
:::

Next, we’ll integrate the newly created Basenames component into your application. For instance, if you have a Header component with a Login button that allows users to connect their wallet, you can display the user's Basename instead of their wallet address after they connect.

Here’s an example of how to modify your header component to include the Basenames component:

```typescript title="src/app/page.tsx"
'use client';
import Footer from 'src/components/Footer';
import { ONCHAINKIT_LINK } from 'src/links';
import { useAccount } from 'wagmi';
import LoginButton from '../components/LoginButton';
import { Basenames } from '../components/basename';

export default async function Page() {
  const { address } = useAccount();
  const account = useAccount();

  return (
    <div className="flex h-full w-96 max-w-full flex-col px-1 md:w-[1008px]">

          </a>
          <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
            {!address && <LoginButton />} {/*Connect wallet button*/}
            {account.status === 'connected' && (
              <div>
                <Basenames address={account.addresses?.[0]} />
              </div>
            )}
            {/* <h1>{result}</h1> */}
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section className="templateSection flex w-full flex-col items-center justify-center gap-4 rounded-xl bg-gray-100 px-2 py-4 md:grow"></section>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, once the user connects their wallet, the Basenames component is conditionally rendered to display their Basename instead of the raw wallet address.

## Conclusion

That’s it! You’ve successfully integrated Basenames into your wagmi/viem app using OnchainKit. Test your application by connecting a wallet and observing how the Basename is displayed instead of the wallet address.

# About Base

Base is a secure, low-cost, builder-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users onchain.

Base is incubated within Coinbase and plans to progressively decentralize in the years ahead. We believe that decentralization is critical to creating an open, global cryptoeconomy that is accessible to everyone.

---

### Ethereum L2

Base is built as an Ethereum L2, with the security, stability, and scalability you need to power your onchain apps. Confidently deploy any EVM codebase and onramp your users and assets from Ethereum L1, Coinbase, and other interoperable chains.

### Big features, small fees

Get the EVM environment at a fraction of the cost. Get early access to Ethereum features like Account Abstraction (ERC4337), simple developer APIs for gasless transactions, and smart contract wallets.

### Open source

Base is built on the MIT-licensed [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), in collaboration with Optimism. We're joining as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure it’s a public good available to everyone.

### Scaled by Coinbase

Base is an easy way for decentralized apps to leverage Coinbase's products and distribution. Seamless Coinbase integrations, easy fiat onramps, and access to millions of verified users in the Coinbase ecosystem.

# How to avoid getting your app flagged as malicious

---

Ensuring that your app is perceived as trustworthy and not flagged as malicious requires attention to best practices. Here’s a quick guide on how to build a secure and compliant app from day one

## Smart Contracts

- **Verify Source Code:** Ensure that the source code of your contracts is verified and publicly available on [block explorers](https://docs.base.org/docs/tools/block-explorers/).
- **Audit Your Contracts**: Having your contracts audited by a reputable firm is crucial. Publish the audit report and provide a reference link to it, so users can easily find it. Audits show that you’ve taken extra steps to secure your smart contracts.
- **Limit User Funds Exposure**: Design your contracts to minimize the exposure of user funds. Use efficient design to reduce any unnecessary risk. For example, request the minimum amount needed to fulfill the transaction.

---

## App Best Practices

- **Accessibility Across Regions**: Avoid geo-blocking or access restrictions that prevent certain regions or countries from accessing your app.
- **Consistent Web2 Behavior**: Avoid rapid or unexplained changes in UI that can make users feel uncertain about the app’s reliability.
- **Transparent Web3 Interactions**: Make sure your app’s web3 interactions are clear and match the UI actions. For example, a “Mint” button should clearly emit a mint transaction.
- **Standard Sign-in Methods**: Provide all standard connection methods for users to sign in, such as WalletConnect / Coinbase Wallet SDK or popular browser extension wallets.

---

## Verification Request

Once you’ve implemented these best practices, consider submitting a verification request through the following [form](https://report.blockaid.io/). This step helps ensure that your app is recognized as safe and verified by trusted sources in the ecosystem.

By following these recommendations, you’ll significantly reduce the chances of your app being flagged as malicious and foster a secure and trustworthy environment for your users.

certain features and distinguish you from other visitors. These technologies are used by
most website and app providers to let users navigate between pages efficiently, ensure
security of the webpage or application, understand how their websites are used, remember
user preferences and generally improve the user experience. More information on cookies
and their use can be found at [aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org) or
[allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org). Cookies set by the website operator

### Strictly Necessary purposes

Strictly Necessary cookies are essential for our Services to function and therefore
cannot be switched off. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you
which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences,
logging in, or filling in forms. These also include cookies we may rely on for security
purposes, such as to prevent unauthorised access attempts. You can set your browser to
block or alert you about these cookies at any time, but some features of our Services
may not work.

### Performance purposes

We use these cookies to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve
the performance of our Services. These cookies help us to know which pages are the most
and least popular and see how visitors move around the Site, and to resolve any errors
that occur on the Services quickly to provide you with a better experience. For example,
our first party base_device_id cookie is used to provide analytics on how our Site and
Services perform. This cookie lasts for 3 months.

## 3. How to Manage Cookies, Similar Technologies and Targeted Online Mobile Advertising

# Decommissioning Public Geth Archive Snapshots

As part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our services, Public Geth Archive Snapshots were deprecated on _December 15th, 2024_. We understand that this change may affect your operations if you rely on these snapshots for maintaining your Ethereum infrastructure. This notice aims to provide you with a potential path forward and offer solutions to ensure a smooth transition.

## Recommended Path Forward

We recommend switching to Reth going forward. We will continue to maintain the Reth archive snapshot.

If you need continued Geth support, we would advise that you maintain your own snapshot that is specific to your infrastructure e.g. EBS on AWS.

If you have any questions or would like assistance, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://base.org/discord) or [GitHub](https://github.com/base-org/base-node).

# Sequencer, Testnet, Basenames Interface Terms

Last Updated: October 25, 2024

---

We’re excited you’re interested in Base, a layer-two optimistic rollup on the Ethereum public blockchain. While we do not control Base, these Terms of Service (“Terms”) constitute a legally binding contract made between you and Coinbase Technologies, Inc. (“Coinbase,” “we,” or “us”) that governs your access to and use of the Coinbase Sequencer, Base Testnet, Basenames Interface, and Basenames Profile Pages each of which is defined below (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Services in any way, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not accept the terms and conditions of these Terms, you are not permitted to access or otherwise use the Services.

**BEFORE WE INCLUDE ANY OTHER DETAILS, WE WANT TO GIVE YOU NOTICE OF SOMETHING UP FRONT: BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES WE MAY HAVE WITH EACH OTHER VIA BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT (INSTEAD OF A COURT OF GENERAL JURISDICTION), AND YOU AGREE TO DO SO AS AN INDIVIDUAL (INSTEAD OF, FOR EXAMPLE, AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS IN A CLASS ACTION). TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAW ALLOWS, YOU ALSO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE OUR [ARBITRATION AGREEMENT](https://docs.base.org/docs/arbitration) “DISPUTE RESOLUTION, ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER.”**

### 1. Base and Bridging Smart Contracts

The Base protocol (“Base”) is an open source, optimistic rollup protocol that operates with the Ethereum blockchain. The Base protocol includes protocol smart contracts that allow you to “bridge” (i.e., lock assets on one blockchain protocol and replicate them on another protocol) digital assets between Ethereum and/or Base (“Bridging Smart Contracts”). **Neither Base nor the Bridging Smart Contracts are part of the Services.** They are both operated through the use of certain open source software such as the OP Stack, an open sourced codebase approved by a decentralized, representative body of Optimism governance (the “Optimism Collective”), and a set of smart contracts that once deployed to the Base protocol are not controlled by Coinbase (even if Coinbase contributed to their initial development). Coinbase does not control what third parties may build on Base, the activity of such parties, any user transacting on Base, or any data stored on Base itself, and Coinbase does not take possession, custody, or control over any virtual currency or other digital asset on Base or the Bridging Smart Contracts, unless expressly stated in a written contract signed by Coinbase. You acknowledge and agree that Coinbase makes no representations or warranties with respect to Base or the Bridging Smart Contracts, and that, if you use Base or the Bridging Smart Contracts, you do so at your own risk.

### 2. Basenames

Basenames is an open source blockchain-based naming protocol that maintains a registry of all domains and subdomains on Base through a series of smart contracts deployed on Base. Basenames is not part of the Services. Users may, through interacting with the Basenames, search such registry, register domains and subdomains and manage their registered names, including by adding metadata and other information (e.g., URLs) to the corresponding text records on the Basenames smart contract (such metadata and other information, the “Basename Profile Information”). The Basenames interface located at https://base.org/names (the “Basenames Interface”) is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing Basenames. You are responsible for conducting your own diligence on other interfaces enabling you to access Basenames to understand the fees and risks that they present.
You understand that anyone can register and own a domain name (and its subdomains) that is not already registered on the registry maintained by Basenames. You further understand that names registered on the registry maintained by Basenames may expire and you are responsible for monitoring and renewing the registration of such names. You acknowledge that Coinbase is not able to forcibly remove, prevent or otherwise interfere with the ability of any person to register a domain name on the registry operated by Basenames and you hereby acknowledge that Coinbase will not be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use any domain names subject of registration, or to be registered, on the registry maintained by Basenames.
You agree that Basenames is purely non-custodial, meaning you are solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys to the digital asset wallets you hold and use to access Basenames.

### 3. Who May Use the Services

You may only use the Services if you are legally capable of forming a binding contract with Coinbase in your respective jurisdiction which may require your parents consent if you’re not the legal age of majority (which in many jurisdictions is 18), and not barred from using the Services under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction, for example, that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and are not located or organized in a U.S. sanctioned jurisdiction. If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity or other organization, you agree to these Terms for that entity or organization and represent to Coinbase that you have the authority to bind that entity or organization to these Terms.

### 4. Rights We Grant You

As between you and us, Coinbase is the owner of the Services, including all related intellectual property rights and proprietary content, information, material, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, trademarks (including the Base logo, the Base name, the Coinbase logo, the Coinbase name, and any other Coinbase or Base marks), service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, video, music, and the “look and feel” of the Services. We hereby permit you to use and access the Services, provided that you comply with these Terms. If any software, content or other materials owned or controlled by us are distributed to you as part of your use of the Services, we hereby grant you a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, and non-exclusive right and license to execute, access and display such software, content and materials provided to you as part of the Services, in each case for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the Services as permitted by these Terms. To use any parts of the contents of the Services other than for personal and non-commercial use, you must seek permission from Coinbase in writing. Coinbase reserves the right to refuse permission without providing any reasons.

### 5. Accessing the Services

To access the Services, Base, or the Bridging Smart Contracts you must connect a compatible cryptocurrency wallet software (“Wallet”). Your relationship with any given Wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of that Wallet provider, not these Terms. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any private key controlled by your Wallet and are fully responsible for any and all messages or conduct signed with your private key. We accept no responsibility or liability to you in connection with your use of a Wallet, and make no representations and warranties regarding how the Services, Base, or the Bridging Smart Contracts will operate or be compatible with any specific Wallet. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to prohibit certain Wallet addresses from being able to use or engage in transactions via the Coinbase Sequencer or from using other aspects of the Services.

As between you and Coinbase, you retain ownership and all intellectual property rights to the content and materials you submit to the Services. But, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license to use your content solely for the purpose of operating the Services (i.e., the Sequencer and Base Testnet) for so long as we operate the Services. To avoid any doubt, this license does not allow us to use your intellectual property beyond operating the Services (e.g., in advertisements).

### 6. The Services

Coinbase offers the following Services that enable you to access and interact with Base and the Bridging Smart Contracts:

- **The Sequencer:** The Coinbase Sequencer is a node operated by Coinbase that receives, records, and reports transactions on Base. While The Coinbase Sequencer is, initially, the only sequencer node supporting transactions on Base, additional nodes may be provided by third parties in the future and there are other mechanisms for submitting transactions through Ethereum. The Coinbase Sequencer does not store, take custody of, control, send, or receive your virtual currency, except for receiving applicable gas fees. It also does not have the ability to modify, reverse, or otherwise alter any submitted transactions, and will not have access to your private key or the ability to control value on your behalf. We reserve the right to charge and modify the fees in connection with your use of the Coinbase Sequencer. These fees may also be subject to taxes under applicable law.
- **Base Testnet:** The Base Testnet is a test environment that allows you to build applications integrated with Base. You are permitted to access and use the Base Testnet only to test and improve the experience, security, and design of Base or applications built on Base, subject to these Terms. Base Testnet Tokens will not be converted into any future rewards offered by Coinbase. Coinbase may change, discontinue, or terminate, temporarily or permanently, all or any part of the Base Testnet, at any time and without notice.
- **Basenames Interface:** The Basenames Interface is a web application and graphical user display operated by Coinbase and located at base.org/names. It enables you to interact with Basenames by creating blockchain messages that you can sign and broadcast to Base using your Wallet. The Basenames Interface will not have access to your private key at any point.
- **Basenames Profile Pages:** Coinbase also operates a web application and graphical user display (the “Basenames Profile Pages”) that renders information about all registered Basenames domains and subdomains on Base, including any Basename Profile Information associated therewith. You understand that the information displayed on the Basenames Profile Pages, including all Basename Profile Information, is stored and publicly available on the Basenames decentralized protocol. Coinbase provides the Basenames Profile Pages only as a convenience, does not have control over any of third party content appearing therein, and does not warrant or endorse, nor bear responsibility for the availability or legitimacy of, the content on or accessible from any Basenames Profile Page (including any resources, interactive features, or links to Third-Party Services (as defined below) displayed therein). When viewing any Basenames Profile Page, you should assume that Coinbase has not verified the safety or legitimacy of, any content, resources, interactive features, or links appearing on such Basenames Profile Page (including any Farcaster Frames (or other open source products that provide substantially similar functionality) rendered thereon). It is your responsibility to ensure that you fully understand the nature of any links or other interactive features that you may be able to access on a Basenames Profile Page, including any financial risks that you may be exposed to when interacting with a Third-Party Service.

### 7. Acceptable Use

You agree that you will not use the Services in any manner or for any purpose other than as expressly permitted by these Terms. That means, among other things, you will not use the Services to do or encourage any of the following:

- Infringe or violate the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including Coinbase) or attempt to decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer the Services;
- Violate any applicable law or regulation, including without limitation, any applicable anti-money laundering laws, anti-terrorism laws, export control laws, end user restrictions, privacy laws or economic sanctions laws/regulations, including those administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control;
- Use the Services in a way that is illegal, dangerous, harmful, fraudulent, misleading, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;
- Violate, compromise, or interfere with the security, integrity, or availability of any computer, network, or technology associated with the Services, including using the Services in a manner that constitutes excessive or abusive usage, attempts to disrupt, attack, or interfere with other users, or otherwise impacts the stability of the Services.
- Use any Coinbase brands, logos, or trademarks (or any brands, logos, or trademarks that are confusingly similar) without our express prior written approval, which we may withhold at our discretion for any reason.

### 8. Release and Assumption of Risk

‍By using the Services, Base, or the Bridging Smart Contracts, you represent that you understand there are risks inherent in using cryptographic and public blockchain-based systems, including, but not limited, to the Services and digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your access and use of Base, the Bridging Smart Contracts, Basenames, and the separate Services offered by Coinbase. That means, among other things, you understand and acknowledge that:

- The Base, the Bridging Smart Contracts, Basenames, and the separate Services may be subject to cyberattacks and exploits, which could result in the irrevocable loss or reduction in value of your digital assets or in additional copies of your digital assets being created or bridged without your consent.
- Base is subject to periodic upgrades by the Optimism Collective. The Optimism Collective may approve a protocol upgrade that, if implemented, may significantly impact Base, and may introduce other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattack vectors, or other changes to Base that could disrupt the operation of Base, the Bridging Smart Contracts, Basenames, or the Services or otherwise cause you damage or loss.
- If you lose your Wallet seed phrase, private keys, or password, you might permanently be unable to access your digital assets. You bear sole responsibility for safeguarding and ensuring the security of your Wallet.

You further expressly waive and release Coinbase, its parents, affiliates, related companies, their officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, representatives. agents, partners, licensors, and each of their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the “Coinbase Entities”) from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way related to your use of the Services, and your interaction with Base, the Bridging Smart Contracts, or Basenames. Also, to the extent applicable, you shall and hereby do waive the benefits and protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

### 9. Interactions with Other Users

You are responsible for your interactions with other users on or through the Services. While we reserve the right to monitor interactions between users, we are not obligated to do so, and we cannot be held liable for your interactions with other users, or for any user’s actions or inactions. If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.

### 10. Feedback

Any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback, reviews, or other information about the Services, provided by you to Coinbase, are non-confidential and Coinbase will be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of these submissions for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment, attribution, or compensation to you.

### 11. Privacy

For more information regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of personal data and certain other data, please see our [Privacy Policy](http://docs.base.org/privacy-policy).

### 12. Third-Party Services

The Services may provide access to services, sites, technology, applications and resources that are provided or otherwise made available by third parties (“Third-Party Services”).

Coinbase has no control over and is not responsible for such Third-Party Services, including for the accuracy, availability, reliability, or completeness of information or content shared by or available through Third-Party Services, or on the privacy practices of Third-Party Services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of Third-Party Services prior to using such services. You, and not Coinbase, will be responsible for any and all costs and charges associated with your use of any Third-Party Services. The integration or inclusion of such Third-Party Services does not imply an endorsement or recommendation. Any dealings you have with third parties while using the Services — including if a Third-Party Service may have infringed your intellectual property rights — are between you and the third party. Coinbase will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any Third-Party Services.

### 13. Additional Services

We or our affiliates may offer additional services that interact with Base, which may require you to agree to additional terms. If, while using an additional service, there is a conflict between these Terms and the additional terms covering that service, the additional terms will prevail.

### 14. Indemnification

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, you will indemnify and hold the Coinbase Entities harmless from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees arising out of or in any way connected with (a) your access to or use of the Services, (b) your violation of these Terms, or (c) your negligence or willful misconduct. If you are obligated to indemnify any Coinbase Entity hereunder, then you agree that Coinbase (or, at its discretion, the applicable Coinbase Entity) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether Coinbase wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms, and you agree to fully cooperate with Coinbase in the defense or settlement of such claim.

### 15. Warranty Disclaimers

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BASE, THE BRIDGING SMART CONTRACTS, BASENAMES, AND THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, COINBASE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND/OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE COINBASE ENTITIES DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT (I) ACCESS TO THE SERVICES, BASE, THE BRIDGING SMART CONTRACTS, OR BASENAMES WILL BE CONTINUOUS, UNINTERRUPTED, OR TIMELY; (II) THE SERVICES, BASE, THE BRIDGING SMART CONTRACTS, OR BASENAMES WILL BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY SOFTWARE, SYSTEM OR OTHER SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY WALLETS; (III) THE SERVICES, BASE, THE BRIDGING SMART CONTRACTS, OR BASENAMES WILL BE SECURE, COMPLETE, FREE OF HARMFUL CODE, OR ERROR-FREE; (IV) THE SERVICES, BASE, THE BRIDGING SMART CONTRACTS, OR BASENAMES WILL PREVENT ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, ALTERATION OF, OR THE DELETION, DESTRUCTION, DAMAGE, LOSS OR FAILURE TO STORE ANY OF YOUR CONTENT OR OTHER DATA; OR (V) THAT THE SERVICES, BASE, THE BRIDGING SMART CONTRACTS, OR BASENAMES WILL PROTECT YOUR ASSETS FROM THEFT, HACKING, CYBER ATTACK, OR OTHER FORM OF LOSS OR DEVALUATION CAUSED BY THIRD-PARTY CONDUCT.

### 16. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER THE COINBASE ENTITIES NOR THEIR RESPECTIVE SERVICE PROVIDERS INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT, OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, BASE, THE BRIDGING SMART CONTRACTS, OR BASENAMES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE COINBASE ENTITIES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COINBASE ENTITIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, BASE, THE BRIDGING SMART CONTRACTS, OR BASENAMES EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID OR ARE PAYABLE BY YOU TO THE COINBASE ENTITIES FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), WHICHEVER IS HIGHER.  
THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN COINBASE AND YOU.

IF ANY PORTION OF THESE SECTIONS IS HELD TO BE INVALID UNDER THE LAWS OF YOUR STATE OF RESIDENCE, THE INVALIDITY OF SUCH PORTION WILL NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THE APPLICABLE SECTIONS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

### 17. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms at any time and your continued use of the Services after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. You should periodically visit this page to review the current Terms so you are aware of any revisions. If you do not agree to abide by these or any future Terms, you are not permitted to access, browse, or use (or continue to access, browse, or use) the Services.

### 18. Notice

Any notices or other communications provided by us under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be posted online, in the Services, or through other electronic communication. You agree and consent to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents, notices and disclosures that we provide in connection with your use of the Services.

### 19. Entire Agreement.

In the event that Coinbase is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. You may not assign any rights and/or licenses granted under these Terms. Any attempted transfer or assignment by you in violation hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

### 21. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any local, state, or federal government agency, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of the provision to the greatest extent possible under any applicable law and the validity or enforceability of any other provision of these Terms shall not be affected.

### 22. Termination; Survival

We may suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Services at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you. Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of the Services, Sections 7 through 27 of the Terms will survive.

You agree that the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and any Dispute, except to the extent governed by federal law.

### 24. Force Majeure

We shall not be liable for delays, failure in performance or interruption of service which result directly or indirectly from any cause or condition beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to, significant market volatility, act of God, act of civil or military authorities, act of terrorists, civil disturbance, war, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or Internet services or network provider services, failure of equipment and/or software, pandemic, other catastrophe or any other occurrence which is beyond our reasonable control and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

These Terms shall not be construed to waive rights that cannot be waived under applicable laws, including applicable state money transmission laws in the state where you are located. In addition, our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms or to exercise any right under these Terms will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of our right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.

### 26. Relationship of the Parties

Coinbase is an independent contractor for all purposes. Nothing in these Terms is intended to or shall operate to create a partnership or joint venture between you and Coinbase, or authorize you to act as agent of Coinbase. These Terms are not intended to, and do not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and foregone. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in these Terms.

### 27. Dispute Resolution, Arbitration Agreement, Class Action Waiver, And Jury Trial Waiver

If you have a dispute with us, you agree to first contact Coinbase Support via our Customer Support page (https://help.coinbase.com). If Coinbase Support is unable to resolve your dispute, you agree to follow our Formal Complaint Process. You begin this process by submitting our [complaint form](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/other/how-to-send-a-complaint). If you would prefer to send a written complaint via mail, please include as much information as possible in describing your complaint, including your support ticket number, how you would like us to resolve the complaint, and any other relevant information to us at 82 Nassau St #61234, New York, NY 10038. The Formal Complaint Process is completed when Coinbase responds to your complaint or 45 business days after the date we receive your complaint, whichever occurs first. You agree to complete the Formal Complaint Process before filing an arbitration demand or action in small claims court.

#### Disputes with Users Who Reside in the United States or Canada

If you reside in the United States or Canada, and if you have a dispute with us or if we have a dispute with you, the dispute shall be resolved through binding arbitration or in small claims court pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement in Appendix 1 below.

As an illustration only, the following is a summary of some of the terms of the Arbitration Agreement:

- Disputes will be resolved individually (in other words, you are waiving your right to proceed against Coinbase in a class action). However, if you or we bring a coordinated group of arbitration demands with other claimants, you and we agree that the American Arbitration Association (AAA) must batch your or our arbitration demand with up to 100 other claimants to increase the efficiency and resolution of such claims.
- Certain disputes must be decided before a court, including (1) any claim that the class action waiver is unenforceable, (2) any dispute about the payment of arbitration fees, (3) any dispute about whether you have completed the prerequisites to arbitration (such as exhausting the support and Formal Complaint processes), (4) any dispute about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies, and (5) any dispute about whether a dispute is subject to the Arbitration Agreement in the first instance.
- In the event that a dispute is filed with a court that does not fall into one of the above five categories, either you or Coinbase may move to compel the court to order arbitration. If the court issues an order compelling arbitration, the prevailing party on the motion to compel may recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

#### Disputes with Users Who Reside Outside the United States and Canada

If you do not reside in the United States or Canada, the Arbitration Agreement in Appendix 1 does not apply to you and you may resolve any claim you have with us relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with our Terms, us, or our Services in a court of competent jurisdiction.

# The Base Token List

This page is intended for token issuers who already have an ERC-20 contract deployed on Ethereum and would like to submit their token for bridging between Ethereum and Base. Base uses the [Superchain token list](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io) as a reference for tokens that have been deployed on Base.

**_Disclaimer: Base does not endorse any of the tokens that are listed in the Github repository and has conducted only preliminary checks, which include automated checks listed_** [**_here_**](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io)**_._**

---

## Adding your token to the list

The steps below explain how to get your token on the Base Token List.

### Step 1: Deploy your token on Base

Select your preferred bridging framework and use it to deploy an ERC-20 for your token on Base. We recommend you use the framework provided by Base's [standard bridge](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/protocol/bridges.md) contracts, and furthermore deploy your token using the [OptimismMintableERC20Factory](https://docs.base.org/base-contracts/#l2-contract-addresses). Deploying your token on Base in this manner provides us with guarantees that will smooth the approval process. If you choose a different bridging framework, its interface must be compatible with that of the standard bridge, otherwise it may be difficult for us to support.

### Step 2: Submit details for your token

Follow the instructions in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io) and submit a PR containing the required details for your token. You must specify in your token's data.json file a section for ‘base-sepolia' and/or ‘base’. The change you need to submit is particularly simple if your token has already been added to the Superchain token list. For example, [this PR](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/commit/27ab9b2d3388f7feba3a152e0a0748c73d732a68) shows the change required for cbETH, which was already on Optimism's token list and relies on the Base standard bridge.

### Step 3: Await final approval

Reviews are regularly conducted by the Base team and you should receive a reply within 24-72 hours (depending on if the PR is opened on a week day, weekend or holiday).

# How to ensure ERC-20 tokens are immediately swappable in Coinbase Wallet

This page is intended for developers that will or have recently deployed ERC-20 token contracts on Base Mainnet and would like their token details to display as quickly as possible on Coinbase Wallet.

Coinbase Wallet makes any ERC-20 token instantly available for swapping seconds from when the contract is deployed.

Follow the instructions below to ensure your token logo, asset name, and other metadata also appear on Coinbase Wallet.

:::info Disclaimer
Base does not endorse any specific token that is deployed on mainnet and made available for swapping.

## Adding your token to the list

The steps below explain how to have your token display quickly on Coinbase Wallet. These instructions work not only for Base, but for any EVM chain supported by Coinbase Wallet (Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, BNB).

### Step 1: Deploy your ERC-20 Token on Base Mainnet

Write and deploy a compliant ERC-20 token smart contract. Test it and then deploy on Base Mainnet.

Once your ERC-20 contract is deployed, your asset is swappable instantly on Coinbase Wallet in the swap flow. Users can search by contract address or asset name. See below for information on how to show price charts and other metadata.

### Step 2: Prepare your metadata and asset images

Prepare a high-resolution image of your token's logo. Ensure it is clear, identifiable, and representative of your token.

### Step 3: List your cryptocurrency on a listing aggregator
##### **Note:** At this time, being listed and verified on CoinMarketCap is the best way to ensure your token’s name, image, price chart all show up on Coinbase Wallet.

You can pay to be listed AND **verified** on CoinMarketCap following these [instructions](https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043659351-Listings-Criteria).

You can list for free on CoinGecko following these [instructions](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/articles/7291312302617-How-to-list-new-cryptocurrencies-on-CoinGecko).

Once CoinGecko lists your token OR CoinMarketCap lists it as **_verified_**, your asset's image logo and other metadata will flow into Coinbase Wallet and can be seen by users. **It can take 24-48 hours for metadata changes to update.**

## Why does my token display in the “Newer tokens” section?

Tokens that are newly launched and have not had significant trading volume appear in this section. Once your token reaches a market cap of at least $10M on CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, the **newer token** label inside Coinbase Wallet is removed.

## Why is there no price chart for my token?

Your token must be listed and marked as verified on CoinMarketCap for the price chart to display on Coinbase Wallet.

If the above guidance doesn’t resolve your issue, please submit more information using this [Deform](https://app.deform.cc/form/a331da5a-447b-43e8-b636-ea3b925e115a/).

# Sharing your token
### Custom trading links
By sharing a unique link to your token’s asset page, your community can more easily interact with your token.

How to get your custom link:

**Step 1:** Grab your custom link for your token by navigating to the asset page on Coinbase Wallet

**Step 2:** Click the share button

:::info Disclaimer
New assets with low liquidity may result in failed swaps or may result in a user receiving less of the destination token due to slippage. An important responsibility of the token creator is to communicate to the community these risks.

# APPENDIX 1: SEQUENCER, TESTNET, AND BASENAMES INTERFACE TERMS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

---

### 1. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement

Subject to the terms of this Sequencer, Testnet, and Basenames Interface Terms Arbitration Agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified and in effect from time to time, the “Arbitration Agreement”), you and Coinbase agree that any dispute, claim, or disagreement arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of Base, the Site, a Coinbase Sequencer, the Services, or the Base Terms (the “Base ToS”) and prior versions of the Base ToS, including claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of the Base ToS (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (1) you and Coinbase may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (2) you and Coinbase must resolve in court any Dispute about infringement, misuse, or misappropriation of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Base ToS as well as claims that may arise after the termination of the Base ToS. Any capitalized term used herein without definition shall have the meaning assigned thereto in the Base ToS.

### 2. Waiver of Jury Trial

YOU AND COINBASE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Coinbase are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the section entitled “Applicability of Arbitration Agreement” above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

### 3. Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief

YOU AND COINBASE AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 8, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party's individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 8 entitled “Batch Arbitration.” Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section, “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,” are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Coinbase agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. All other Disputes that are not severed shall be litigated in small claims court or arbitrated. This section does not prevent you or Coinbase from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

### 4. Rules and Forum

The Base ToS evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (**“AAA”**), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the **"AAA Rules"**) then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.

A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the **“Request”**). If you initiate the arbitration, you must provide Coinbase a copy of your Request by email at [arbitration@coinbase.com] or through Coinbase’s registered agent for service of process. The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, email address of the party seeking arbitration, and the username and wallet addresses (if any) associated with the applicable Account(s); (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought, including an accurate, good faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) if you are the party making the Request, a statement certifying completion of the Formal Complaint Process as described in the Base ToS; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.

If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.

Unless you and Coinbase otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 8 is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.

You and Coinbase agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.

### 5. Arbitrator

The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) business days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 8 is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.

### 6. Authority of Arbitrator

The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to the section entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,” including any claim that all or part of the section entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief” is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief” has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in the section entitled “Batch Arbitration,” all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (5) all Disputes about whether a Dispute is carved out from arbitration in the Section above entitled “Applicability of Arbitration Agreement” shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in the section entitled “Batch Arbitration.” The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. This means that, among other things, you and we agree that an arbitral award shall have no preclusive effect in any other proceeding involving other parties. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. In any award of damages, the arbitrator shall abide by the “Limitation of Liability” section of the Terms.

### 7. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs

The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you or Coinbase need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Formal Complaint Process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

### 8. Batch Arbitration

To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Coinbase agree that in the event that there are one hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Coinbase by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (**“Batch Arbitration”**).

All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (**“Administrative Arbitrator”**). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Coinbase.

You and Coinbase agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.

This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.

### 9. Modification

If we make any updates to the Arbitration Agreement, we will make the updated terms available to you by publishing them on the Site. Your continued use of the Site and/or Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Site following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.

### 10. Severability

If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any local, state, or federal government agency, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of the provision to the greatest extent possible under any applicable law and the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement shall not be affected.
